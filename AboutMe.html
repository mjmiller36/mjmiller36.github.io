			<b> An Introduction to Me: </b>
			<p> I am currently a senior at UW-Madison, studying Strategic Communications and Business. </p>
			<p> I am from Milwaukee, WI and have 2 younger sisters and one (adorable) dog at home. </p>
			<p> I live with 5 roommates in Madison - we love watching movies (especially rom-coms), going out on State Street and trying new restaurants. </p>
			<p> In my free time, I like to read, try new recipes and visit my friends in different cities/states. </p>
			<p> I'm taking LIS 351 to fulfill I/A credits in the school of Letters & Science, but I've enjoyed learning basics of computer hardware and coding. </p>
			<p> I hope you enjoy reading about me and learning about my favorite recipe! </p>
